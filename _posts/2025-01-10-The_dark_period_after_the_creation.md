# The dark period after the creation.

`And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters - Gen 1:2
`

The first verse of the bible started with a complete and perfect truth: 

`In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. - Gen 1:1
`
Unfortunately, the second verse introduce us to a shocking and confused statement : *the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep*

Then that lead us to a curious question:

>  Did God created the earth as empty, dark and chaos?

In the testimony of Moses, we are told that God is upright and perfect and all his works is perfect.  [(Deu 32:4)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2032%3A4&version=KJV)

The bible further revealed that God is light and in him no darkness.  [(1 John 1:5)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201%3A5&version=KJV)

If all God's work is perfect and in him there is no darkness, then the earth was created good and perfect before the earth later become chaotic or in darkness.

God revealed clearly to us through Prophet Isaiah that He did not create the earth in vain (or void). [(Isaiah 45:18)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2045%3A18&version=KJV)

`For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the Lord; and there is none else - Isaiah 45:18
`

> What makes the earth void and without form?

From the direct verse of Gen 1:1-2, God did not revealed to us why the earth became dark, empty and void.

Firstly , we have to know that the creation story was centre on the redemption of mankind through His son, Jesus Christ. As a bible reader , we have to fine tuned our study of the bible that  Jesus Christ is the main character of the story. [(Luke 24:44)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024%3A44&version=KJV)

However, the dark period after the creation might have been related to the fall of lucifer who weaken the nations, [(Isaiah 14:12)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2014%3A12&version=KJV) but God did not give us a direct details as the creation story was centre on Jesus Christ, the Redeemer.

> How does the fall of Lucifer relate to the dark period after creation?

The book of Revelation revealed a great revolt in heaven [(Rev 12:1-12)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2012%3A1-12&version=KJV) where the devil and like one-third of the angel were casted down to the earth. We also see that in verse 12 that it was said terrible things will happen to the earth and the sea : *Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.*

We also known the angels rejoiced and shouted for joy at the creation: *Tell me how I fixed the foundations of the earth.Who made it stay in its right place? I did! At the dawn of that day, the stars sang together.They sang for joy with all the angels* [Job 38:6-7-EasyBible Version](https://www.easyenglish.bible/bible/easy/job/38/). Then the angels were in existence before the earth was created.

Jesus Christ affirmed the revolt recorded in [(Rev 12:1-12)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2012%3A1-12&version=KJV) when he said:
 *I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven* [(Luke 10:18)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010%3A18&version=KJV).

Further affirmation was recorded in [(Isaiah 14:12-17)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2014%3A12-17&version=KJV) that Satan was fallen from heaven and *make the world as a wilderness* (vs 17).
