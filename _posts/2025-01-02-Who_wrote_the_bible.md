# Who wrote the Bible?.

`Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. - 2 Peter 1:20-21
`

In the creation scene, we know that human has not yet been created. Moses was credited to have written the first five book of the Holy Scripture.

Jesus Christ asserted that the scripture were written concerning him, giving credibity to the Holy Scripture written before him. [(Luke 24:44)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024%3A44&version=KJV)


If Moses was not there at the beginning , then how was he able to give an account of what happened at the creation and other scene recorded in the law of Moses?

The answer is that God's Holy Spirit revealed it to holy men.  [(2 Peter 1:20-21)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201%3A20-21&version=KJV)

The Bible give us understanding how men can bridged the event of years  by the inspiration of the Almighty through his Holy Spirit which give understanding that the aged cannot understand. [(Job 32:7-9)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2032%3A7-9&version=KJV)

>What do we know about God's Holy Spirit as the revealer of the word?

The Holy Spirit was there at the beginning. [(Gen 1:2)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201%3A2&version=KJV) 

The Holy Spirit knows everything, even the deep things of God. [(1 Cor 2:9-11)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202%3A9-11&version=KJV) 

>What about the books written after Jesus?

Jesus promised the disciple the Holy Spirit which will teach us all things. [(John 14:26)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A26&version=KJV)

All God's word given by inspiration of God [(2 Tim 3:16)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%203%3A16&version=KJV) 

All God's word are revealed by the Holy Spirit to holy men [(2 Peter 1:20-21)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201%3A20-21&version=KJV)

All God's word are valid, and Jesus came to fulfill it. [(Matthew 5:17-18)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A17-18&version=KJV)
