# God the Creator?

`In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. - Gen 1:1
`

The above first statement in the bible gives us clarity about three truth we need to know about the universe:

- Who created the universe?
- When the universe was created?
- What was created?

> The Who?
God created the heaven and the earth. No doubts about it. A very simple and profound truth.

God is eternal. No one created him. The bible tell us we have to believe He is.

> The When?
God created the Heaven and the earth from the beginning. No doubt about it. 

> The What?
God created the universe from nothing. He created something from nothing.
