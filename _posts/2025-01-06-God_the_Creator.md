# God the Creator?

`In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. - Gen 1:1
`

The above first statement in the bible gives us clarity about three truth we need to know about the universe:

- Who created the universe?
- When the universe was created?
- What was created?

> The Who?
God created the heaven and the earth.  [(Heb 1:10)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201%3A10&version=KJV) ; [(Gen 1:1)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201%3A1&version=KJV)

No doubts about it. A very simple and profound truth. 
The bible tell us we have to believe He is the Creator and we have to believe by faith. [(Heb 11:3)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011%3A3&version=KJV) ; [(Heb 11:6)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011%3A6&version=KJV)

Our believe should not be by any scientific or human reasonings but by faith. Same way Job could not answer the questions God asked him about creation, Same way our conquest to research who created the universe would be in vain. [(Job 38-40:5)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2038-40%3A5&version=KJV) . Just believe that God is the creator, and we can only do it by faith.[(Heb 11:6)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011%3A6&version=KJV)



God is eternal. His years shall not fail. [(Heb 1:10-12)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201%3A10-12&version=KJV) .
 No one created him. The bible tell us we have to believe He is.

> The When?
God created the Heaven and the earth from the beginning. No doubt about it. He was there before the beginning.   [(Psalm 90:2)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2090%3A2&version=KJV);[(Heb 1:10)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201%3A10&version=KJV) 



> The What?
God created the universe from nothing. He created something from nothing. [(Heb 11:3)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011%3A3&version=KJV)

`Because of faith, we understand about how God made the universe. He spoke his word to make it happen. In that way, God made all the things that we can see. 
He made them from things that nobody could see. - Heb 11:3 (EasyBible Version)
`

Human quest to know how God created the heavens and earth would not yield result.

> The Why?
One good question to ask further is why God created the universe?
