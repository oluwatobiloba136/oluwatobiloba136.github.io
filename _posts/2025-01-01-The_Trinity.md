# The Pre-existence of Christ.
`In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. - Gen 1:1
`

`...And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness - Gen 1:26
`

One interesting question to ask in the above text is:

- Who is God talking to?


The answer to the above questions is God is Trinity - God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit. God is enjoying the relationship among the Trinity.

`The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all - 2 Cor 13:14
`

>The Trinity in Action

The Trinity can be seen in actions as revealed in the following passage:

```
The Spirit [*God the Holy Spirit*] of the Lord God [*God the Father*] is upon me [*God the Son*]; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound - (Isaiah 60:1)
```

```
And Jesus [*God the Son*], when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God [*God the Holy Spirit*] descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:

 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, [*God the Father*] This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. - (Matthew 3:16-17)
 ```
