# The Pre-existence of Christ.
`In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. - Gen 1:1
`

`...And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness - Gen 1:26
`

An interesting question to ask in the above text is:
- What was God doing before the creation? 
- Who is God talking to?
- Who created God himself?

The answer to the above question is God is trinity - God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit.

`The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all - 2 Cor 13:14
`

>Who is God the Father?

`No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. - John 1:18
`

God the Father is a Spirit [(John 4:24)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%204%3A%2024&version=KJV), which no one has seen.

He revealed his identity when Moses requested for his presence [(Exodus 33:20)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2033%3A20&version=KJV)

He is the invisible God [(Col 1:15)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201%3A15&version=KJV)
